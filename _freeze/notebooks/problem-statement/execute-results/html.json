Despite the efficiency of modern high-resolution imaging systems like MRI and CT in reducing noise, their high cost and limited availability prevent widespread implementation, especially in public health infrastructures. Thus, enhancing the diagnostic quality of existing imaging modalities via advanced denoising methods is both an essential and sustainable solution for improving global healthcare.\n\nConventional denoising algorithms, especially deep learning-based approaches, often rely on the availability of clean, noise-free reference images for training. In medical imaging, such ground-truth data is rarely available, complicating efforts to denoise noisy medical scans effectively. Although recent methods—such as Noise2Noise, Noisier2Noise, and Recorrupted-to-Recorrupted—have demonstrated success in learning from noisy data without clean references, they remain largely constrained to synthetic and general-purpose image datasets (Lehtinen, 2018; Moran et al., 2020 ; Pang et al., 2021). The complexity and specificity of medical image noise, often non-linear in nature, present challenges these methods are ill-equipped to handle.\n\nIn their recent work, Floquet et al. (2024) introduced an automatic tuning mechanism for denoising algorithms that circumvents the need for ground-truth images, employing Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function and optimizing through gradient descent. While this approach has demonstrated effectiveness on datasets such as BSD400, particularly in linear noise scenarios, its gradient-based optimization framework faces challenges when applied to non-linear noise models, which are prevalent in medical images.\n\nBuilding on this foundation, we propose to extend Floquet et al.'s framework to tackle non-linear noise by incorporating nature-inspired optimization methods—such as genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization. These techniques are well-suited for complex, non-linear optimization landscapes, overcoming the limitations posed by gradient descent. Our approach aims to enhance the robustness of denoising algorithms, particularly in the context of medical imaging, where noise is often more intricate, and ground-truth clean images are typically unavailable. This advancement holds potential not only for improved diagnostic accuracy but also for making high-quality medical imaging more accessible in resource-constrained healthcare environments, aligning with broader goals of sustainability and equity in global health systems.\n\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n## Optinal write-up\nFloquet et al. (2024) introduced an innovative approach for automatic parameter tuning of denoising algorithms, circumventing the need for ground-truth images. Their method, which relies on Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function and gradient descent for optimization, has shown efficacy in managing linear noise and was benchmarked against state-of-the-art models such as Noise2Noise, Noisier2Noise, and Recorrupted-to-Recorrupted using the BSD400 dataset.\n\nDespite these successes, medical imaging presents unique challenges, as noise in these contexts is often non-linear and more complex. Gradient descent, though efficient in linear scenarios, struggles to optimize such non-linearities, highlighting the need for more versatile optimization techniques.\n\nIn response to this limitation, we propose extending Floquet et al.'s framework by integrating nature-inspired optimization algorithms, including genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization, specifically tailored for non-linear noise scenarios in medical images. These methods are particularly adept at exploring multi-dimensional, non-convex search spaces, providing a robust alternative to traditional gradient-based methods.\n\nThis approach will not only enhance the accuracy and robustness of denoising in medical imaging but also address the broader issue of accessibility. In regions where advanced imaging technologies are not available, improving the performance of existing systems becomes crucial. By refining denoising techniques, we aim to support more accurate diagnostics in resource-constrained healthcare settings, thereby contributing to more sustainable and equitable healthcare solutions globally.\n\n:::\n\n",
